CLI client for Imgur

##Why

There's a [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/imgur) but it doesn't support the Imgur [authenticated API](http://api.imgur.com/resources_auth). I'll probably publish this as a gem as well.

##Use

Make sure you have `json` and `oauth` gems installed. You'll also need an API Key and Secret from Imgur. Get it by visiting [this link](http://imgur.com/register/api_oauth). 

Then simply run the script, and follow the wizard.

##Extend

A sample call to the user's albums is included. Use the [Imgur API Docs](http://imgur.com/register/api_oauth) to find out more.
